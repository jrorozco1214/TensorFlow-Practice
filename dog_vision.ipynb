    "Id the breed of a dog given an image of a dog.\n",

    "When Im sitting at the cafe and I take a photo of a dog, I want to know waht breed of dog it is\n",

    "The ddata wer're using is from Kaggle's dog breed identification competition\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Evaluation\n",
    "The evaluation is a file with prediction probailitesi for each dog breed of each test image. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Features\n",
    "Some information about the data:\n",
    "* We're dealing with images (unstructured data) so it's probably best we use deep learning/transfer learing\n",
    "* There are 120 breeds of dogs (this means there are 120 different breeds of dog)\n",
    "* There are around 10,000+ images in teh training set (these images have labels)\n",
    "* There are around 10,000+ images in the test set (these images have no labels, because we'll want to predict them)\n"
